React Todo application.

<img src="src/assets/images/todo.png">

## :rocket: Functionalities
**Main functionalities:**

* Task can be added to the list for each of the three states (to-do / in progress / done)
* After clicking add button, the task element appears on the screen, where you can enter the title and description of the task
* The task must have at least a title - adding without a title is not possible and the user is informed about it

**Unfinished functionalities:**
* Saving tasks after exiting the web browser
* The ability to move tasks between states (Drag and Drop)
